# Introduction

The current project provides a sample **XML validator configuration** for the fictional EU Purchase Order specification.
The validator realises the demo scenario considered in the Test Bed's [XML validation guide](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/docs/guides/latest/validatingXML/index.html). You may check this out for the full description of this repository's resources and 
validator configuration.

The live validator defined through this configuration is available [here](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/order/upload).
